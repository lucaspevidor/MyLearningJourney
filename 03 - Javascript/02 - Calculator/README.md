# Simple Calculator
This was my first project using HTML, CSS and JS.
It has event listeners for keyboard interaction.

Also I decided to make a calculator without the `0` key just because I can :P

```
Keys 1 to 9 -> Numbers
Backspace   -> Clear number
Delete      -> Clear all
+ - * / =   -> Operations
Enter       -> Same as =
```
